# CPongC
Pong clone written in C and SDL2.

It is made in codeblocks.

It requires GCC and SDL2.

A version of SDL2 (2.0.5) is included but I strongly suggest to download the last one from the website: www.libsdl.org.

All the credits and a huge thank you for SDL2 go to Sam Lantiga, the defunct Loki Software and all the development team.
