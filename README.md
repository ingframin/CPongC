# CPongC
Pong clone written in C and SDL2.
It requires codeblocks and SDL2 to run properly.
At the moment there is a bug which prevents to run it outside codeblocks, if you can help me with that it would be much appriciated.
It requires GCC and SDL2.
A version of SDL2 (2.0.5) is included but I strongly suggest to download the last one from the website: www.libsdl.org.
All the credits and a huge thank you for SDL2 go to Sam Lantiga, the defunct Loki Software and all the development team.
